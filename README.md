This is a sample problem making use of the Strategy design pattern to avoid certain code pitfalls.


The code is developed on an Ubuntu machine in Idea IntelliJ.

The directory structure is as->

lib -> holds dependency jars
src/main/usu -> source code
src/test/usu -> unit tests
input.xml -> sample input file in xml
input.json -> sample input file in json
outputFile -> output is generated in this file
