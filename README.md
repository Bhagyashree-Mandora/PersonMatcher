# PersonMatcher
Use of Strategy Design Pattern to determine if two records belong to the same person. Different strategies (or algorithms) are applied to decide if the reccord is the same person or not. Different strategies are also applied to read and write different record formats.  

This is a sample problem making use of the Strategy design pattern to avoid certain code pitfalls.  


The directory structure is as->  

lib -> holds dependency jars  
src/main/usu -> source code  
src/test/usu -> unit tests  
input.xml -> sample input file in xml  
input.json -> sample input file in json  
outputFile -> output is generated in this file
